# scrumola
The vision of this project is to create an application that would facilitate distributed Scrum teams to use consensus based estimatation technique for thier Sprint backlogs. Since Planning Poker seems to be the most popular one that most Scrum teams are adopting, the app will be modeled after it.

The project will be devided into 2 phases. The goal of phase one will be to build an app that runs on OpneShift with no integration with the OpenShift.io Planner. In the phase two, this app will be integrated into the Planner, so that the Sprint Backlog and collaborators can automatically generated during a Sprint planing session.

Built With Angular 4
